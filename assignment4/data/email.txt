Dear Prof Vernon, 

Please my name is Asantewaa Bremang, I am taking your course  DSA. I need a little clarification on the display of the textfile in the output file right before the maximum number of probes. So my concern is that when we are given a textfile with only non-alphanumeric characters, for example, "!!!\n !!!\n !!!\n". Should the output file be A or B:

(A)
abremang
../data/textfile1.txt
!!!
!!!
!!!
Maximum number of probes: 0
Average number of probes: 0.0
--------------------

(B)
abremang
../data/textfile1.txt
Maximum number of probes: 0
Average number of probes: 0.0
-------------------- 

Also, if I have a textdata file with the sentence "Ernest don't get closer to the fire!!!", should the output be

../data/textfile1.txt
Ernest don't get closer to the fire!!!
Maximum number of probes: 
--------------------

 or
abremang
../data/textfile1.txt
Ernest DONT get closer to the fire
Maximum number of probes: 0
-------------------- 

Thank you and I do hope to hear from you in your earliest convenience.
 
Best regards, 
Asantewaa Bremang
